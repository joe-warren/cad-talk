This is a quote from the Author of OpenSCAD

I think of this first quote as "Rob Pike coded"

(When he said "They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language", about Go developers)

It's not that there's not a place for OpenSCAD, but there's also room for tools with a different design philosophy.
